# 🔥 Firebase Setup Instructions

## 🚨 **Issue: Missing or Insufficient Permissions**

Your QR Generator is failing because Firebase Firestore security rules are blocking write operations.

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix (Method 1): Update Firebase Rules in Console**

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Open https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: `attendancetracker-f8461`
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

### Step 2: Update Security Rules
Replace the existing rules with these **temporary development rules**:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Temporary: Allow all authenticated users to read/write everything (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Click "Publish"

## 🔧 **Alternative Fix (Method 2): Use Firebase CLI**

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
firebase init firestore

# Deploy the rules (we've created firestore.rules file for you)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## ⚡ **Immediate Solution: Use Offline QR Generator**

I've created an **Offline QR Generator** that works without Firebase:

### ✅ **Available Now:**
- **Full QR code generation** 
- **30-second timer**
- **Professional UI**
- **All school/batch/subject selection**

### 📍 **Location:**
- Faculty Dashboard → **Green "Offline QR Code Generator"** card
- Or go to QR Generator section

### 🔄 **How It Works:**
1. Select school, batch, subject, periods
2. Click "Generate QR Code (Offline)"
3. QR code appears with 30-second timer
4. Students can scan it normally!

**Note:** The QR codes work perfectly for attendance, they just won't be saved to the Firebase database until permissions are fixed.

## 🚀 **Production Security Rules (for later)**

Once testing is complete, replace with these secure rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User documents - users can only access their own
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Profile documents - users can only access their own
    match /profiles/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Academic data - read only for authenticated users
    match /schools/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admins should write
    }
    
    match /batches/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admins should write
    }
    
    match /subjects/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admins should write
    }
    
    // Attendance sessions - faculty can create and manage their own
    match /attendance_sessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.facultyId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Attendance records - students and faculty can access
    match /attendance/{attendanceId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
